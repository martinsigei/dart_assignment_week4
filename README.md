## String Manipulation:
Concatenation: concatenateStrings combines two strings.
Interpolation: interpolateString demonstrates string interpolation.
Substring Extraction: extractSubstring extracts a portion of the string.
Case Conversion: toUpperCase() and toLowerCase() handle case conversion.
Reversing a String: reverseString reverses the user input string.
Length Calculation: .length gives the length of the string.
## Collections:
The string operations are stored in a List called operationsList.
Each string manipulation result is added to the list and later saved to a file.
## File Handling:
Write to File: The File class is used to write the results to a file named output.txt.
Error Handling: A try-catch block ensures that any file write errors are handled gracefully.
## Date and Time:
The current date and time are obtained using DateTime.now().
The formatDate function formats the date and time in a readable format.
Future and past dates are calculated by adding/subtracting days using Duration.
The difference between two dates is calculated using difference.
